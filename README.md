## Usage
Search for installed browser extensions and internal pages via the keyword `ch`:
- <kbd>⏎</kbd> Open page, or the respective extension settings.
- <kbd>⌘⏎</kbd> Open the extension at the Chrome Web Store.
- <kbd>⌥⏎</kbd> Copy the Chrome Web Store URL of the extension.
- <kbd>⇧⏎</kbd> Open the local file path of the extension.

## *Browser support
Currently, only Chrome and Brave are supported. Adding support for more browsers
is easy, as long as they are Chromium-based. Making a few additions to this
[JSON
file](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-chromium-extensions/blob/main/scripts/browser-vars.json)
is all that is needed, and mostly self-explanatory.

## About the developer
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in touch.
